# BSU_redesign
Redesign of Bridgewater State University's website (my Honors Thesis Project)

This project was over the entire course of 2017. I began by researching UI, UX, and HCI, to see how users view and use websites. 
<p>I then anaylzed trends in other university websites as well as popular social media websites to figure out what design aspects are popular and align with what I researched.</p>
<p>I then anaylyzed BSU's current website in order to find its exact faults, and brainstormed how to fix them.
Using my background knowledge of graphic design and front-end web design, I rebuilt BSU's website so that it is more modern, up-to-date, more clean, and, most importantly, more user-friendly.</p>
<p>I conducted a user testing experiment in order to gather user feedback. 100% of participants preferred this redesign to the current BSU website.</p>
<p>This information was reviewed by the university's website redesign team, and they will be taking my findings and ideas into consideration.</p>
